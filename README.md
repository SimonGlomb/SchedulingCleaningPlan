# SchedulingCleaningPlan

Solves a optimization scheduling problem for a cleaning plan for 6 people.

Constraints are that 2 people to one bathroom and the 4 other do the other bathroom.
Also every week every person has to do exactly one room.

The goal is a schedule which is optimized for fairness and maximizing the time difference between having a room done two times by the same person.

As a result, all people have at least 4 weeks break.
